> ### The world is run by those who show up - _Robert B. Johnson_

I'm Neil -- husband, father, coach, live (sports) streamer, programmer, serverless architect, leader, and recovering entrepreneur.  My personal mission is to help software engineers find joy in their work by sharing knowledge and reducing friction.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently leading the design and development of a multi-instance digital experience platform that ensures seamless experiences while empowering autonomous teams
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently digging pretty deeply into delivery (and caching) optimization options for a multi-billion user platform to optimize cost AND deliver faster time to first byte (TTFB)
- ðŸ“š I'm currently reading [The Medici (Italian Histories)](https://a.co/d/35Wh5Ad) and [Engineering Management for the Rest of Us](https://a.co/d/4G0Qfun)
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about microfrontends, serverless applications, scaling teams and projects, removing friction for developers
